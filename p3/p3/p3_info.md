1. Write an SQL query to create a new dataframe about baseball players who attended BYU-Idaho. The new table should contain five columns: playerID, schoolID, salary and the yearID/teamID associated with each salary. Order the table by salary (highest to lowest) and print out the table in your report.
2. This three-part question requires you to calculate batting average (number of hits divided by the number of at-bats)
    1. Write an SQL query that provides playerID, yearID, and batting average for players with at least 1 at bat that year. Sort the table from highest batting average to lowest, and then by playerid alphabetically. Show the top 5 results in your report.
    1. Use the same query as above, but only include players with at least 10 at bats that year. Print the top 5 results.
    1. Now calculate the batting average for players over their entire careers (all years combined). Only include players with at least 100 at bats, and print the top 5 results.
3. Pick any two baseball teams and compare them using a metric of your choice (average salary, home runs, number of wins, etc). Write an SQL query to get the data you need, then make a graph using Plotly Express to visualize the comparison. What do you learn?
